The College of Staten Island
Department of Mathematics
MTH 229 Calculus Computer Laboratory
Fall 2020 Course Outline
The main objective of this course is to reinforce calculus concepts and explore the application
of calculus to solving problems by making use of a series of computer projects. The student will
be first introduced to mathematical software. In particular, MATLAB software will be used in this
course. MATLAB has capabilities for both numerical and symbolic calculations. It can also create
graphical output so that the results can be visualized more readily.
The following projects are integrated with the material covered in courses MTH 230 Calculus
I with Pre-Calculus and MTH231 Analytical Geometry and Calculus I. Therefore, full appreciation
of these projects requires a solid understanding of the course material.
1. Using MATLAB as a Calculator
2. Plotting Graphs in MATLAB
3. More on Graphing with MATLAB
4. Graphical Solutions to Equations
5. Investigating Limits in MATLAB
6. Approximate First and Second Derivatives
7. Critical and Inflection Points
8. Newton’s Method
9. Optimization
10. Definite Integrals and Riemann Sums
• You will use the MATLAB software to perform the tasks described to you in the projects.
Please note that MATLAB must be installed on your PC and is not ‘embedded’ in the web
browser. The College has a site license for student use. Go to http://www.mathworks.com/
and create an account using your COLLEGEEMAIL, very important. Once you log in, you
should be able to see links to adownloadable .exe file suitable for install on your device – for
personal use.
• Examinations: There will be a midterm and a final examination.
